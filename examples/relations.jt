Relations can reduce the possible solutions something may have. For example,

x = xx
x?

This will print:
x ∈ {0, 1}

Yet if we introduce that x is not equal to 0:
x ≠ 0
x?

Then this will print:
x = 1


Relations can also be used for further simplifications.
a = b/b
a?

This will print
a = b/b
since we can't simplify it on account of b potentially being 0.

If we show this isn't the case,
b > 0
a?

Then we get
a = 1
